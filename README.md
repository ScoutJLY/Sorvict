Chell is a Sorceries girl, she has a younger brother named Charles. They were living a normal life with their parents along with a small Sorceries community in Pax. But everything changes when her mother, Melissa being executed by Sapiens after exposed her identity as  Sorceries. Out of sorrow and anger, Melissa’s brother, Atlas decided that he want to avenge for her. With Melissa’s death as a trigger, Atlas formed a rebel group called The Resistance who plan to fight against the Sapiens. Although Chell lost her mother, she understands that forming a rebel group means putting the whole community in the risk of exposing identity to Sapiens. She tried to convince the Atlas to stop, eventually failed. When she wanted to give up and leave the city for safety, she found out that her younger brother, Charles, joined The Resistance as well. With no other options, she can only fight her way to stop the rebel group and her brother with her own hands before it is too late.
